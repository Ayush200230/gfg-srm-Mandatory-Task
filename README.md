Documentation of my Code-

In this program, I created a Prediction Simualator.
here first i imported random library and then printed the statement "This is a Prediction Simulator"
and then gave value 'y' to variable 'x' and then created a list to store 'head' and 'tail' in it.
then a while loop is started where i equated x to y to run the loop if it's true 
and used random to get random values. if head is coming then there is no prediction but if tail is coming i am making it to redirect at another phase 
where dice is thrown and according to the number coming on the dice, prediction is printing accordingly. 
and in the end i used input to take input from the user as 'y' to once again run the program and if anything else then 'y' is inputed program will end.
